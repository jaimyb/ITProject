# VSCodeNewProject
Rapidly creates a new project in VSCode for local development using webpack and TypeScript.  

My intention for this project, is to get you up-and-running quick for local development and to demostrate basic web development patterns (using TypeScript, CSS, Sass, installing fonts/images, etc).  With just a couple of CLI commands and mouse clicks, you will hopefully have a local development server running that will detect any changes to source.  Those changes can be CSS, Sass, images, TypeScript and HTML.  This project has the webpack loaders listed below, but of course, you can add or remove any for your needs.
* css-loader
* extract-loader
* file-loader
* url-loader
* html-loader
* node-sass
* sass-loader
* style-loader
* ts-loader

## Prerequisites
* VSCode, Google Chrome and npm installed
* 'Debugger for Chrome' extension installed for VSCode.

## Instructions
Clone this repository, set location to project folder and install packages:
```
E:\> git clone https://github.com/marckassay/VSCodeNewProject.git

E:\> sl ./VSCodeNewProject

E:\> npm install
```

After installing, open VSCode and select:

    Tasks > 'Run Task' and select '(Start) Webpack Dev Server' 
from the tasks list.

That will start webpack's dev server.  Now just launch Chrome in a debug session:

    Debug > Start Debugging

If everthing goes as intended, you should see the follow webpage being served by localhost:
